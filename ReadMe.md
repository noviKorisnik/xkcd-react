# xkcd-react
___
One try to bring fun of [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) using react. I found out that they provide public api, this app actually uses it!

An important notice is that this project runs together with [server proxy](https://github.com/noviKorisnik/dotnet-proxy#readme).

And... all is presented in just several snapshot branches - not so big project, but is of great fun!
* [snapshot001](https://github.com/noviKorisnik/xkcd-react/tree/snapshot001#readme) only to create react application
* [snapshot002](https://github.com/noviKorisnik/xkcd-react/tree/snapshot002#readme) introducing typescript support, data model and data fetching provider... all that with service test failure!
* [snapshot003](https://github.com/noviKorisnik/xkcd-react/tree/snapshot003#readme) resolving cors issue with real proxy and provide neat visual interface
