## new app, again
Welcome to the new beginning, here is used the same starting template as earlier (maybe not the best, hope some moment will come to test that too)
```
npx create-react-app xkcd-react
```
## cleaning
Well, template provided extra something we don't need, such is to delete and clear.
## what are we gonna do the next?
... the next snapshot branch will tell (like I don't know that at this point)...
